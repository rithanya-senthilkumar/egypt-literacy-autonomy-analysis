# Egypt Literacy & Financial Autonomy Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between **female literacy rates** and **financial autonomy** in Egypt. Using survey data, the analysis reveals a surprising **U-shaped trend** — as literacy rates initially rise, women’s financial autonomy declines before increasing again.  
The findings challenge the assumption that higher literacy always leads to greater empowerment.

## Data
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/wellbeing-of-women-in-52-countries  
- **Variables:**
  - Female literacy rate (%)
  - % of women in a union who are paid for their work **and** decide alone how to use their earnings

## Methodology
1. Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis.
2. Created a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between literacy rates (x-axis) and financial autonomy (y-axis).
3. Identified and interpreted the U-shaped pattern.
4. Explored possible explanations using literature and context on Egypt’s sociocultural environment.

## Findings
- Literacy increases from ~36% to ~46% while financial autonomy **drops** from ~30% to ~16%.
- After ~46% literacy, financial autonomy starts rising again, reaching over 30% at ~54–55% literacy.
- Possible reasons for the initial drop:
  - Cultural change lagging behind educational gains
  - Women entering the workforce but lacking bargaining power at home
  - Male backlash as women gain skills

## Discussion
The results highlight that **education alone may not be enough** to improve women’s autonomy without parallel changes in cultural norms, economic opportunities, and household power dynamics.
